# Python - If/Else, Loops, and Functions

This directory contains exercises and projects related to conditionals (`if/else`), loops (`for` and `while`), and functions in Python. These are fundamental concepts in programming and will help you understand how to control the flow of your programs.

## Topics Covered

- **If/Else Statements**: Learn how to control the flow of your program by making decisions based on conditions.
- **Loops**:
  - `for` loops to iterate over sequences.
  - `while` loops for more flexible iterations.
- **Functions**: Writing reusable blocks of code with `def`.
- **Comparison Operators**: Understand how to compare values.
- **Logical Operators**: Learn how to combine conditions with `and`, `or`, and `not`.

## Project Structure

Each Python script in this directory is an exercise focused on a specific topic. The exercises are designed to give you hands-on practice with these fundamental programming concepts.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd python-if_else_loops_functions
