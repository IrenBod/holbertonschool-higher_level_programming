# Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

## Introduction

In this project, we explore two powerful data structures in Python: **Sets** and **Dictionaries**. These data structures allow efficient storage and manipulation of data, providing unique ways to handle collections of data.

### Sets
A **set** is an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets are useful for eliminating duplicate entries and performing operations such as unions, intersections, and differences between groups of data.

#### Key Features of Sets:
- **No Duplicates**: Sets automatically remove duplicates.
- **Unordered**: Sets do not preserve the order of elements.
- **Operations**: Sets support operations like:
  - Union: Combine elements from multiple sets.
  - Intersection: Find common elements between sets.
  - Difference: Find elements present in one set but not in another.

### Dictionaries
A **dictionary** is a collection of key-value pairs. Dictionaries allow efficient access to values by using their associated keys.

#### Key Features of Dictionaries:
- **Unique Keys**: Each key in a dictionary must be unique.
- **Mutable Values**: The values associated with the keys can be changed.
- **Unordered**: Dictionaries do not preserve the order of key-value pairs.
- **Efficient Lookup**: Dictionaries allow fast retrieval of values using keys.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this project, you will:
- Understand how to create and manipulate sets and dictionaries in Python.
- Be able to perform set operations like union, intersection, and difference.
- Know ho
