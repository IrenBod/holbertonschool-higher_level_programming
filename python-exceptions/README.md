# Python - Exceptions

This project focuses on learning how to handle exceptions in Python. You will work with `try`/`except` blocks to manage errors and ensure your code runs smoothly, even in unexpected scenarios.

## Concepts Covered
- Understanding and using `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks.
- Raising exceptions intentionally using `raise`.
- Handling different types of exceptions (`IndexError`, `ValueError`, etc.).
- Writing safe and efficient code that deals with potential runtime errors.
- Catching multiple exceptions in a single `try` block.

## Project Tasks

1. **Safe Print List**
   - Write a function that prints `x` elements of a list.
   - Return the actual number of elements printed.

2. **Safe Print Integer**
   - Write a function that prints an integer with a `try`/`except` block for safe printing.

3. **Print and Count Integers**
   - Write a function that prints the first `x` integers in a list and returns the number of integers printed.

4. **Safe Print Integer List**
   - Write a function that prints the first `x` elements of a list, safely checking for integers.

5. **Raise Exception**
   - Write a function that raises a `TypeError` exception with a custom message.

6. **Raise Exception with Message**
   - Write a function that raises a `NameError` exception with a custom message.

## Usage

To test any of the functions, use the following command:
```bash
./<function_name>.py
